"""Filter quality measured against labelled data, not inferred from retention.

Retention was the only quality evidence this category produced, and it cannot
distinguish a gate that keeps 93% of a corpus from one that discards exactly the
7% that was good. These tests pin the harness that answers the other question,
and the failure modes it has to exercise: Unicode normalisation, local digits,
OCR noise, code-mixing and language-ID errors.
