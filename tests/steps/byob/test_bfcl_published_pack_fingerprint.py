"""Refuse a pack edit that would stop every eval of an already published release.

An eval scores a benchmark only against the pack revision that certified its
gold traces, and the fingerprint covers every file in the pack directory. So an
edit anywhere in a published pack — a helper module, a fixture, or only the
README — makes each downstream eval fail preflight with
``eval_source_oracle_pack_drift``, hours later and on someone else's machine.

`banking-vn-gold-v1-1392` was published from `banking_vn` 0.1.0 and is still
scored, so that directory is frozen. This test is where that fact is enforced,
at the commit that breaks it rather than at the next eval.
