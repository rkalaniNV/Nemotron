# BFCL MCP support matrix

This page states what the MCP onboarding path can prove today. It is intentionally stricter
than a feature list: an implemented transport does not make an endpoint Gold-eligible.

## Rollout status

The MCP path is **experimental and feature-flagged**. Discovery, deterministic catalog
normalization, the MCP-to-BFCL gateway, evidence-bound authoring, P4–P11 evidence, review, freeze,
and publication handoff exist for Mode A. A discovery-only gateway still attests `L0`; only a
gateway restarted with strict BFCL-produced target evidence and a passing controlled P9 suite can
attest `L2`, and the existing BFCL Gold Gate independently reruns and verifies that evidence.

Live discovery, gateway startup, and intake are disabled by default. Set
`BFCL_ENABLE_MCP_MODE_A=1`. `BFCL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP` remains an alias for one
deprecation window; if both variables are present they must agree. Omitted, false,
misspelled, unknown-kind, and conflicting settings fail closed. Offline review and
verification of already-produced artifacts do not need a rollout flag.

Do not describe an MCP pack as Gold merely because it has:

- an endpoint conformance document;
- a completed human review;
- an immutable frozen release; or
- a gateway that can execute tools.

Those are necessary evidence, not substitutes for fresh BFCL validation.

## Capability matrix

Every implemented/refused claim names its executable evidence. Broader adapter status is
in [bfcl-authoring-support-matrix.md](bfcl-authoring-support-matrix.md).

## Supported operating modes

- **Mode A — cooperative server:** implemented and experimental; server exposes reviewed
  describe/reset/state/end controls
  ([`test_bfcl_mcp_gateway.py`](../../../../../tests/steps/byob/test_bfcl_mcp_gateway.py)).
- **Mode B — shimmed server:** **unimplemented** executable target.
- **Mode C — immutable read-only snapshot:** **unimplemented** executable target.

Mode is not a quality tier. `L0`, `L1`, and `L2` describe independently attained conformance:

- `L0`: discovery identity is reproducible.
- `L1`: executable behavior has passed the P4 boundary, but is not publishable.
- `L2`: reset, state, isolation, mutation, confirmation, replay, and failure handling have all
  passed the applicable independent probes and the endpoint may proceed to the Gold Gate.

## Deferred extensions

The following are explicit deferrals, not silently supported behavior:

- non-object `structuredContent` projection;
- MCP Tasks and elicitation/input-required exchanges;
- mid-run catalog refresh;
- trust in server annotations without an explicit profile decision;
- signed-release `L2` without a cryptographic verifier; and
- publication from a server that cannot expose deterministic state and episode isolation.

The normative contracts are
[bfcl-mcp-oracle-contract.md](bfcl-mcp-oracle-contract.md),
[bfcl-mcp-architecture-decision.md](bfcl-mcp-architecture-decision.md), and
[bfcl-mcp-threat-model.md](bfcl-mcp-threat-model.md).
