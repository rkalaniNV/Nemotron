# BFCL workflow acceptance matrix

This file states the production-readiness acceptance criteria for assisted authoring and
binds each one to the test that would fail if it were violated. The point of keeping the
criteria in the repository is that "backed by a named test" becomes a checkable claim
rather than an assertion in a review thread.

Add a row when you add a criterion, and give it the next `AC-` number. A criterion with
no owning test is not a criterion; it is an intention.

## How this file is enforced

`test_bfcl_authoring_documentation.py::test_workflow_acceptance_criteria_are_backed_by_named_tests`
parses the table below and fails when a criterion names no test, or names a test
function that does not exist in `tests/steps/byob/`. Owning tests are listed as
`file.py::test_name`. A criterion may not be marked as owned by a file alone.

Ownership means the named test fails if the criterion is violated. It does not mean the
criterion is fully proven; [bfcl-authoring-support-matrix.md](bfcl-authoring-support-matrix.md)
records where coverage is still partial.

## Criteria

| ID | Criterion | Owning tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AC-1 | Existing manual Oracle Packs and generation tests remain unchanged and passing. | `test_bfcl_stages.py::test_manual_oracle_packs_require_no_flow_two_adapter_metadata`, `test_bfcl_stages.py::test_manual_gold_tier_ignores_adapter_and_certification_fields` |
| AC-2 | The LLM authoring pipeline emits only canonical pack files accepted by `load_pack()`. | `test_bfcl_mcp_release_review.py::test_freeze_atomically_seals_the_canonical_pack_and_lineage`, `test_bfcl_authoring_e2e.py::test_real_local_guided_publication_runs_stage_all` |
| AC-3 | The frozen pack is independently revalidated and reaches Gold before generation, and its source adapter is certified at the A2 tier by independently verified probe evidence. | `test_bfcl_authoring_release.py::test_v2_freeze_requires_a2_certification`, `test_bfcl_authoring_e2e.py::test_guided_publish_completes_stage_all_with_fresh_gold`, `test_bfcl_authoring_release.py::test_publication_refuses_fresh_validation_for_a_different_pack` |
| AC-4 | No target-model output, score, or identity is used as generation evidence. | `test_bfcl_authoring_refusals.py::test_refusal_schema_cannot_carry_model_output_or_scores` |
| AC-5 | Before production default rollout, held-out status must be explicit: required partitions are selected and redacted before authoring; not_applicable requires a reviewed reason; undeclared absence blocks before the first model call. | `test_bfcl_pack_drafting.py::test_missing_held_out_state_stops_before_first_model_call`, `test_bfcl_pack_drafting.py::test_v2_refuses_missing_held_out_proof_before_model_or_output`, `test_bfcl_authoring_held_out.py::test_clean_redaction_proof_is_signed_and_evidence_bound` |
| AC-6 | Every model call has a request hash, response hash, prompt version, model canonical ID, seed, and inference settings. | `test_bfcl_pack_drafting.py::test_a_full_drafting_run_writes_drafts_provenance_and_compiled_assertions`, `test_bfcl_pack_drafting.py::test_a_second_run_is_served_from_the_immutable_cache` |
| AC-7 | No automatic semantic repair may exist. Before production rollout, every model correction must be a new immutable, approved revision and must not modify schemas, oracle behavior, source identity, or fixtures. | `test_bfcl_authoring_cli.py::test_answer_commits_a_revision_that_must_be_reauthorized_and_reapproved`, `test_bfcl_authoring_questions.py::test_answers_create_a_new_evidence_revision_without_mutating_parent`, `test_bfcl_authoring_revisions.py::test_complete_revision_is_manifest_bound_and_immutable` |
| AC-8 | Nondeterminism, timeout, identity drift, evidence mismatch, unsafe probing, schema/oracle mismatch, and unclear business meaning fail closed. | `test_bfcl_authoring_revisions.py::test_resume_refuses_source_identity_drift`, `test_bfcl_authoring_revisions.py::test_resume_refuses_bound_artifact_drift`, `test_bfcl_authoring_refusals.py::test_refused_session_can_create_revision_only_with_bound_authorization` |
| AC-9 | Human approval binds exact source evidence, validation report, adapter identity, pack fingerprint, and freeze inputs; stale approval cannot authorize changed bytes. | `test_bfcl_authoring_revisions.py::test_resume_refuses_stale_approval`, `test_bfcl_authoring_generalized_review.py::test_generalized_review_verifies_common_trust_records_for_every_adapter`, `test_bfcl_authoring_generalized_review.py::test_review_refuses_a_validation_report_the_bound_config_did_not_write` |
| AC-10 | A generated tiny reference pack completes the existing stage=all workflow and produces verified final artifacts. | `test_bfcl_authoring_e2e.py::test_real_local_guided_publication_runs_stage_all` |
