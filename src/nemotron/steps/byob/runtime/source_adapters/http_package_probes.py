"""The HTTP half of the probe ladder: reviewed sessions against a live oracle.

A reviewed HTTP package could always be checked for identity and catalog, which is A0, but
nothing above that, because intake never called a tool. That left two of the three
transports permanently below the ladder they were said to share.

Nothing about the questions on the ladder needed a local backend, though, and neither does
the worker: it already reaches an HTTP oracle by opening a session, sending calls, and
deleting the session afterwards. So this module supplies only what HTTP means — one episode
is one endpoint session, the catalog is what `/v1/tools` serves, and identity is the
metadata the endpoint still agrees to — and `probe_engine.py` asks the questions.

An endpoint that stops matching its reviewed identity part-way through is the reason
identity is re-checked at the end: the calls in between were made against something else.
