"""The MCP half of the probe ladder: reviewed sessions against the live gateway.

MCP intake could only ever reach A0. Not because Mode A cannot be reset or isolated — it
is required to be, that is what mode A means — but because intake never called a tool.
Discovery answers P1 through P3 and defers P4 through P11, so the certification report had
nothing above identity and catalog to project, and the tier followed from that silence.

The gateway, though, already serves BFCL Oracle HTTP v1: sessions, calls, state, and
delete. That is the same surface the endpoint transport is probed through, so the ladder
does not need an MCP-shaped copy of itself. This module supplies only what Mode A means —
one episode is one gateway session that pushes fixtures into the reset control tool, the
catalog is what the gateway publishes, identity is the discovery pin the gateway attested
to — and `probe_engine.py` asks the questions.

Two hops make drift a live concern rather than a theoretical one: the gateway can stay up
while the MCP server behind it is replaced. Identity is therefore re-checked after the
probes, and the check goes through the gateway rather than around it.
