"""The ``nemo_evaluator_bundle`` writer: canonical projection to a launcher bundle.

The bundle prepares evaluation input and nothing else. It does not run a candidate
model and it publishes no metric, so every file here describes what to ask and how
to compare an answer, never what a model scored.

Six files, all under one directory so the bundle can be moved or archived whole:

``bundle.json``
    The descriptor a launcher reads first. It names the other files, pins the
    dataset's hash and record count, and cites the benchmark it came from.
``dataset.jsonl``
    One record per line, in publication order.
``dataset.schema.json``
    Derived from the record model rather than written by hand, so the schema
    cannot drift away from the records beside it.
``metadata.json``
    Pack, run, and shape descriptors a report can slice on.
``evaluator.yaml``
    The W5 adapter input contract and scoring policy. It is intentionally not a
    standalone Launcher run config: endpoint, registered environment, and tool
    resource service belong to model evaluation rather than dataset publication.
``system_prompts.json``
    The prompt catalog, keyed by ``system_prompt_id``.

Unlike the BFCL question record, a bundle record keeps the whole rendered trace
including the recorded tool results. A multi-turn function-calling evaluation has
to hand the model the result of the call it just made in order to reach the next
turn, so the results are input here, not an answer key. What the bundle does not
carry is any way to re-execute the pack's tools, which is why the declared metrics
stop at what a scorer can check from the records alone.

Bytes are deterministic for the same reasons as the BFCL writer: sorted keys, no
incidental whitespace, ``\\n`` endings, and UTF-8 left unescaped. The whole bundle
is encoded, digested, and validated before any file is created, so a projection
that cannot be expressed leaves nothing behind to be mistaken for a bundle.
