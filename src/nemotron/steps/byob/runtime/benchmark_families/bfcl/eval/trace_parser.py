"""Flatten a recorded episode into the shape a scorer can read, and nothing more.

The client parsed the provider's bytes once, under strict JSON, and the driver
recorded the result. Parsing them again here would give a second opinion about
what the model said, and the two could disagree — so this module never touches a
raw response. It reads :class:`CandidateEpisode`, lines it up against the
:class:`ConversationScript` that produced it, and hands the scorer a flat trace
with stable coordinates: turn index, position within the turn, and the argument
status the client already determined.

Nothing is repaired and nothing is filled in. A call with unparseable arguments
stays a call with unparseable arguments; a turn the episode never sent is listed
as never sent rather than invented as an empty turn. What the parser does insist
on is that the episode and the script are two halves of the same replay, because
a score derived from mismatched halves would silently grade the wrong task.
