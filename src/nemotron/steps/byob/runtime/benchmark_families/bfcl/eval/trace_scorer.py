"""Turn one recorded episode into one task score, and nothing else.

The scorer is a pure function of evidence and policy. It reads a
:class:`CandidateEpisode`, the :class:`ConversationScript` that produced it, and
the pinned :class:`EvalScoringConfig`; it contacts no provider, executes no tool,
reads no clock, and re-parses no provider bytes. Scoring the same episode twice
therefore produces the same ``score_hash``, which is what makes a published
number auditable after the endpoint it came from is gone.

Two design choices are worth stating, because they decide what a gate rate means.

*Coverage versus consistency.* ``tool_selection`` and ``arguments`` are coverage
gates: they ask whether the whole gold trace was requested, so gold calls in
turns the episode never reached count against them. ``call_grouping``,
``call_ordering``, and ``text_turn`` are consistency gates: they ask whether what
the candidate did do was well-formed, so they are measured only over turns that
were actually asked. Whether the conversation finished at all is its own gate, and
because that gate always applies, no unfinished episode can be a success.

*No repair, ever.* A call whose arguments never parsed stays unparsed, a call
naming an undeclared tool stays undeclared, and a config that asks for LLM repair
is refused rather than quietly ignored. A score that had been repaired would be a
property of the repairer.
