"""Who a model is, and who touched the benchmark (schema 1.0).

A contamination gate asks one question: did the model under evaluation already
see these tasks while they were being built? Answering it requires comparing two
identities that were written by different parts of the system, for different
reasons, and that do not share a vocabulary.

*Generation* records the models it drove in ``run_manifest.json`` under
``models.<role>``: a serving route (``provider`` plus ``model``), an opaque
operator-chosen ``canonical_id``, and whatever weight identity the operator
supplied — often just the model name, because a generation run only needs to
name what it called, not prove which bytes answered.

*Evaluation* records candidates under the evaluation config contract, which is stricter: an
immutable revision or a weights digest is mandatory, because a score is claimed
about specific weights.

Neither identity is a superset of the other, so :func:`compare_model_identity`
weighs both axes and returns one of three verdicts. The asymmetry that matters
is which way an ambiguous comparison falls: here it falls to ``unknown``, never
to ``different``. Config validation compares candidates *to each other* and keeps identifiers
case-sensitive, because collapsing two case-variants would hide a real
difference between two candidates. This module compares a candidate to a model
that already read the benchmark, where the dangerous mistake is the opposite
one, so every string comparison here is case-insensitive and model names are
matched on a normalized form. An ``unknown`` verdict costs an operator a pinned
identity; a wrong ``different`` verdict costs the benchmark its validity.
