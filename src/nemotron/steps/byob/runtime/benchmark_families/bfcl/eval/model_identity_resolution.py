"""Work out a candidate's weight identity instead of asking an operator to type it.

Pinning weights is what makes a score reproducible, but the operator is rarely
the one who knows the pin. A registry already publishes the commit behind a tag;
a local checkout already contains the bytes; a hosted frontier route publishes
neither and never will. Asking a person to paste a value in all three cases
produces one correct answer, one tedious answer, and one invented answer, and the
invented one is the dangerous answer because nothing downstream can tell it from
a real pin.

So each case is resolved from the thing that actually knows it, and the case that
cannot be resolved is recorded as itself rather than filled in. Nothing here
derives a digest from a model name: a hash of ``gpt-5.6`` identifies the string
``gpt-5.6``, and reading it as weight identity would let a provider swap the
weights under a config that still claims to be reproducible.
