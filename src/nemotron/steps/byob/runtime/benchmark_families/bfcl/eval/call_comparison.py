"""The one comparison that decides both continuation and score.

Two consumers ask the same question of a candidate turn. The conversation driver
asks it to decide which recorded tool result a call has earned; the trace scorer
asks it to decide whether the call was right. If those two answers could differ,
a release gate stricter than the scorer would end an episode the scorer would
have credited, and a correct model would fail a task on transport grounds. So the
comparison lives here once and both callers import it.

Nothing here reads a config file, contacts a provider, or produces a number. It
takes a gold call, a predicted call, the row's tool declarations, and the pinned
:class:`EvalScoringConfig`, and reports what is the same and what is not. The
distinction between *name matched* and *arguments matched* is kept rather than
collapsed, because the driver needs one bit and a report needs both: a model that
called the right tool with a wrong amount is a different failure from one that
called the wrong tool.
