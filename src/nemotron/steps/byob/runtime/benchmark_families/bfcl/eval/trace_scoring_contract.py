"""What a trace score is, gate by gate, for one candidate on one task.

A score is only comparable if it says what it measured. So a task score is not a
number with a label: it names every gate the scoring contract defines, says
whether that gate applied to this row, and — when it failed — which turn and
which call failed it. ``task_success`` is then derived from those gates rather
than asserted alongside them, and a validator refuses a score whose success bit
disagrees with its own gates.

Gates that do not apply are recorded as ``not_applicable`` rather than omitted or
counted as passes. A single-call row has no ordering gate, and a report that
silently dropped it could not be told apart from one where ordering was checked
and passed.

A failed gate also says whose failure it is. An unreachable endpoint and a wrong
tool both fail the task, and neither is softened, but a run whose gates failed on
infrastructure is a run to re-drive rather than a model to reject. The
classification lives on the gate because the scorer is the last place that knows
why the gate failed; every reader downstream projects it rather than re-deriving
it from a status it would have to interpret again.

Every hash here is path-free and time-free. A score cites the script and episode
it was derived from, the complete evaluation-config identity, the pinned scoring
policy, and the content hash of the prose contract that defines the comparison.
Human diagnostics remain in the document but outside the hash; stable reason
codes carry their semantics. Re-scoring the same evidence under the same rules
therefore reproduces ``score_hash`` exactly, and rewording a diagnosis does not
fork it.
