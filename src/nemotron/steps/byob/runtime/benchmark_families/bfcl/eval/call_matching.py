"""Whether one assistant turn earns the tool results the benchmark recorded.

A replayed conversation has one recorded result per gold call, so continuing past
an assistant turn requires deciding *which gold call each predicted call is*. That
decision is the driver's, and it is transport rather than scoring: it selects the
observation the candidate sees next. The scoring component re-derives its verdict
from the recorded episode rather than trusting this gate's continuation decision.

Agreement between the two is structural rather than reviewed: every comparison
this gate makes comes from :mod:`call_comparison`, which the scorer reads as well.
What remains here is only the continuation question — is this turn's group
answerable at all, and does it satisfy the row's ordering policy — so a gate that
was stricter than the scorer would have to be written as a difference in this
file rather than as a drifting reimplementation.

The gate is deliberately an injected :class:`ContinuationGate` so a runtime can
substitute one, but the pinned publication semantics live here and are read from
:class:`EvalScoringConfig` rather than hard-coded.

    Ordering within one assistant turn follows ``call_order``: a turn's calls are
    issued at once, so ``any`` accepts a permutation of the gold group, ``strict``
    requires every gold position, and ``prefix`` requires only the configured
    global prefix before matching the remainder as a set. Ordering *across* turns
    is not negotiable here — the driver walks the scripted turns in order, so a
    candidate that defers a group to a later turn ends the episode. That is a real
    restriction of trace replay, not a scoring rule: the recorded result for a
    group is only meaningful at the point the trace reached it.
