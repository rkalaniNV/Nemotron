"""Drive one authorized task through one candidate, one turn at a time.

The driver is a state machine over a :class:`ConversationScript`. It sends the
answer-free prefix, asks the candidate for one assistant turn, decides — through
an injected :class:`ContinuationGate` — whether that turn earns the tool results
the benchmark recorded, injects the next scripted user request, and repeats until
the trace ends or the episode cannot faithfully continue.

Three things it deliberately does not do. It does not score:
:class:`CandidateEpisode` is evidence consumed by a separate scorer. It does not
execute a tool: the results it releases are the ones benchmark replay recorded,
so a candidate's answer cannot depend on a live fixture. Live execution is a
separate runtime mode. And it does not decide policy: turn budget, timeouts, and
matching flags all arrive from the pinned ``eval_config.yaml``.

Determinism is what makes an episode re-runnable. Everything the driver chooses is
a function of the script, the config, and the candidate's own bytes; nothing reads
a clock except the episode deadline, and that only ever ends an episode early.
