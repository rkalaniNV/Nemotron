"""Typed failures for evaluation source verification.

A config error says the operator wrote something invalid. These errors say
something else: the *source* an already-valid config points at is not the
publication the config resolved, or is not safe to evaluate in the requested
mode. Those are separate families on purpose, because the recovery differs —
one is an edit, the other is "regenerate, or evaluate the run you actually
published".

Every failure names the artifact, states the constraint, and reports the
observed evidence. Evidence is rendered by :func:`render_evidence`, which
prints content hashes and counts verbatim — a mismatch nobody can see the two
sides of is not a diagnosis — and reduces everything else to its shape. Nothing
here ever receives a credential: endpoint configs are resolved through the
loader that keeps only environment variable *names*, so no token, header value,
or API key exists at this layer to leak.

Identifiers minted by this pipeline (run ids, task ids, pack ids, file names)
do appear in the prose, because a report that will not name the run it rejected
cannot be acted on.
