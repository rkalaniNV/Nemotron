"""Prove that an eval config names the committed benchmark publication.

Config resolution recorded what the operator *named*. This module reads it back
from disk and holds it to that record before a candidate token is paid for:

1. ``run_manifest.json`` is the publication commit marker, and its bytes still hash to
   what the config resolved. Without a manifest, a parquet beside it is an
   unpublished artifact, not a benchmark.
2. Both benchmark tables hash to what the publication declares — in three
   independent places (the publication section, the artifact section, and the
   resolved config), which must all agree.
3. The two tables satisfy the publication contract: publication *selects*
   raw rows, it does not rewrite them, and no held-out row ships.
4. The published parquet decodes under the benchmark schema this build reads,
   into a unique, addressable task set.
5. For ``executable`` mode, the oracle pack still fingerprints to what generation
   certified, and the resource that will be executed is the one the pack's own
   manifest selects.
6. Every model that read a published row while it was being built is named, with
   the rows it read. This is the inventory the contamination gate uses, and it
   is collected here because "which models shaped this benchmark" is a fact
   about the source, provable from the same manifest and the same rows.

Nothing here is a second implementation of those contracts. The publication
semantics come from :mod:`...publication_contract`, the row decode from
:mod:`...export_projection`, the pack file set and fingerprint from
:mod:`...pack_loader`, and the endpoint identity from :mod:`...endpoint`. A
verifier that re-derived any of them could disagree with the pipeline that wrote
the artifact, and then the disagreement would be the bug.

Two things are deliberately out of scope. A live endpoint is never contacted:
requiring one would make an offline trace-only evaluation impossible, and the
endpoint's *current* identity is an execution-time question. And no oracle task
is replayed: verification proves the backend imports and exposes its interface,
while replay is the runner's work.
