"""Decide which rows each candidate may be scored on.

A verified source also says which models read its rows. This module compares
those models against the candidates and turns the answer into an authorization:
:class:`...contamination_contract.EligibleEvalPlan`.

The decision has three moving parts, and the order they are applied in is the
contract.

*Compare, then classify.* Every candidate is compared against every exposure.
A ``match`` is a violation. A ``different`` is silent. An ``unknown`` — the two
identities cannot be told apart — is recorded as evidence and never treated as
either, because guessing in one direction clears a contaminated candidate and
guessing in the other destroys a valid benchmark.

*Apply the policy, which only ever narrows.* ``fail_run`` refuses the run;
``exclude_row`` removes exactly the rows the exposure covers. Unresolved
evidence does neither: it does not shrink a task set on suspicion, and it does
not abort a debug run. What it always does is block publication — and when the
operator asked for a publishable run, the refusal happens here rather than
producing a number that cannot be published.

*Intersect last.* Under ``common_intersection`` every candidate is scored on the
rows all of them may answer, so the comparison is comparable by construction.
Under ``per_candidate`` each keeps its own set, which is why the evaluation
configuration contract refuses to call such a run publishable.

Nothing here contacts a model or reads the benchmark again: the gate runs on the
verified handle alone, so it cannot disagree with what was verified.
