"""The one reading of a pack's declared assertion capabilities.

Validation and executable projection both need to know what an assertion is
compatible with and which metric it feeds. They read it here, from the literal
assignment in the pack's ``assertions.py``, so a pack cannot be admitted by one
stage and refused by the other. Requiring a literal is what lets the reading
happen without importing pack code.
