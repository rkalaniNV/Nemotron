"""The single fixture filter dialect shared by validation and expansion.

Both stages must agree on what a slot filter means: if validation accepts an
expression that expansion rejects (or the two match different rows), a pack can
pass its gold gate and still fail to expand.

The expression is parsed with Python's own parser and then walked over a closed set
of nodes, rather than split on operator text. Splitting cannot tell an operator from
the same characters inside a string, so a perfectly ordinary value — a title holding
" and ", a code holding "==" — either raised or silently matched nothing.
