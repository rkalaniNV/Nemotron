# converges on one preferred phrasing, so wording diversity saturates at roughly one
# surface per template no matter how many bindings exist. These axes are the request
# for diversity: each binding is assigned one, so repeated bindings are asked for
# different sentence forms rather than the same rewrite. Since Stage 11 counts masked
# surfaces, the axis count is what bounds the scale a pack can publish.
#
# Every axis is structural or register-level on purpose. An axis that asked for
# shortened numbers, abbreviated identifiers, or converted units would rewrite
# protected values, and the must_preserve guard would then reject the variant.
