"""The Gold Gate check that decides whether an attested endpoint may publish.

The check runs for every endpoint oracle. Omitting an attestation is legal for smoke execution
but is an explicit non-Gold result; otherwise deleting the block from a generated pack would
remove the check that was supposed to protect it. Local Python oracles remain outside this
endpoint-specific gate.

Three digests have to agree before anything is published: the one the pack pinned at intake,
the one the live endpoint reports at `GET /v1/metadata`, and the one inside the attestation
itself. Each is produced by a different party at a different time, so agreement is the only
evidence that the build being certified is the build answering calls.
