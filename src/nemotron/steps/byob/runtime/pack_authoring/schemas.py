"""Output schemas for the authoring calls, shaped so the model states intent, not facts.

The design rule here is that a model should not be *able* to express a value it has no
evidence for. Where that can be enforced by shape it is: a validation case names the
*source* of each argument rather than a literal, so "make up a plausible account id" is not
a sentence this schema can say. Where shape cannot enforce it — prose fields, tool names —
`grounding.py` checks the response against the bundle afterwards.

Every draft carries `blocked_on`. At `L0` most concrete expectations are unavailable, and a
draft that admits which unknown it is waiting on is reviewable; one that quietly omits the
expectation looks finished.
