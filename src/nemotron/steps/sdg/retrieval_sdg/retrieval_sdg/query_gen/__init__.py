"""Query generation (Module B) — synthesize diverse seed queries FROM the corpus.

Reads the on-disk chunk corpus directly (streaming), samples a bounded pool,
clusters it in embedding space, then generates end-user questions across topic
clusters x question kinds (multi-hop = related same-cluster chunks). Optionally
validates each query is answerable by the live retriever. Output feeds query_prep.

    corpus.jsonl -> reservoir_sample -> embed+cluster -> units(kind x chunks)
                 -> generate (LLM) -> validate -> queries.jsonl
