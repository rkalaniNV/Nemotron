"""Integrity measurement of a curated corpus, read from the files on disk.

Three properties this module is careful about, because getting them wrong makes
the resulting report worse than no report:

*Readable is not complete.* A shard can parse perfectly and still be missing
rows. Nothing here claims completeness; the caller may only do that against a
producer-emitted manifest.

*A row delta is not an error.* Filtering removes records on purpose. A delta is
reported as an observation, and only a producer's own declaration can turn it
into a finding.

*Digest independence has to be named.* :func:`corpus_digest` is independent of
the order files are enumerated in, and deliberately not independent of their
names — losing that would mean the report could no longer say which shard
changed. Independence from how rows are distributed across shards is a
different, more expensive guarantee, provided by :func:`containment`.
