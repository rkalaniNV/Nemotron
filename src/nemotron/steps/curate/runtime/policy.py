"""Filtering policies and the line between proposing one and approving one.

Distribution analysis can say what a threshold removes. It cannot say whether
what it removes is worth removing — that needs a training run, or at minimum a
human looking at the documents. So the output of profiling must not be
executable.

Three artifacts keep that separation honest:

``profile_report.json``     measurements. Not a policy.
``candidate_policies.yaml`` proposals, ``approved: false``. Not executable.
``approved_policy.yaml``    promoted by a person or an ablation. Executable.

This module can write the first two. It has no function that writes an approved
policy, and :func:`write_candidate_policies` refuses a document claiming to be
one. Promotion is a separate, deliberate, recorded act.

    number inside it is the judgement the profile explicitly declines to make.
