"""Turn a raw corpus into what the rest of the category can read.

Two things stood between "here is my data" and running the flow, and both were
being pushed onto the user:

**Format.** Corpora arrive as parquet at least as often as JSONL, and the reading
here is thin on purpose — Curator's ``ParquetReaderStage.read_data`` would serve
if it streamed, and calling it does *not* require a cluster, whatever an earlier
version of this docstring claimed. Two narrow differences are why it is not
called. It reads a whole file (``pd.read_parquet(path)`` per path, then
``concat``) where this streams row-group by row-group, and a corpus shard is
routinely larger than the memory of the machine someone first tries this on. And
``pd.read_json(lines=True)`` raises on the first malformed line, taking the file
down; here an unparsable line is counted and reported, because a corpus with
forty bad lines in ten million should be describable, not fatal.

**Identity.** ``subset`` and ``decontamination`` are statements about *sets of
document ids*, and most web corpora carry none. This is the part Curator really
does not cover. Its readers can generate ids, but ``_generate_ids_func`` assigns
``np.arange(min_id, min_id + num_rows)`` from a Ray actor: positional, so
resharding renames every document and any claim made about the old ids silently
becomes false — and cluster-bound, so ids cannot be minted before one exists. So
an id is minted from content instead: reshard, reorder, re-split, and it does not
move.

That choice has one consequence this module refuses to hide. Two byte-identical
documents mint the *same* id, because by that definition they are the same
document. Real corpora contain them — 328 of 20,000 in one Hindi corpus measured
here, the largest group 293 copies — so the collision is not hypothetical, and
what to do about it is a decision with three defensible answers. It is the
caller's, not this module's: see :data:`ON_DUPLICATE`.
