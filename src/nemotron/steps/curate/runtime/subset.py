"""Stratified token-budget subsets that nest.

A filtering ablation compares two policies. If policy A retains 80% of a corpus
and policy B retains 95%, training on whatever survives measures filter quality
and dataset size at once, and the two cannot be separated afterwards. Fixing the
token budget is what makes the comparison mean anything.

Two properties are wanted from such a subset and **cannot both hold**. With
documents of 4, 3 and 2 tokens, the selection that packs a budget of 4 most
fully is ``{4}`` and the one that packs 5 most fully is ``{3, 2}`` — and
``{4}`` is not a subset of ``{3, 2}``. So a choice is forced, and this module
makes it explicitly:

    **Nesting is guaranteed. Filling the budget is not.**

Three consequences run through everything below:

1. Every tier is produced from **one plan in one run**. Tiers computed
   independently cannot be shown to nest, whatever ordering they used.
2. Selection within a stratum is a **prefix** of a single fixed ordering. A
   prefix of a fixed sequence is nested in any longer prefix by construction,
   which is a stronger statement than a test over the tiers that happened to be
   requested.
3. Per-stratum quotas use a **house-monotone** apportionment, so raising the
   budget can only add documents to a stratum, never swap one out. The obvious
   method — largest remainder — is not house-monotone, and its failure mode is
   silent: see ``largest_remainder`` and the test that pins it.

Shortfall is reported, never redistributed. Moving a stratum's unfilled tokens
to another stratum would change the composition of the subset to hit a number,
which is the opposite of what a stratified subset is for.
