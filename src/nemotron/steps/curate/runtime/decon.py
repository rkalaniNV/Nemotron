"""Document near-duplicate overlap between a training corpus and a holdout.

**Threat model, fixed and narrow.** This detects *whole-document
near-duplicates*: a training document largely the same as a holdout document.

It does **not** detect a short benchmark question embedded in a long training
document. Whole-document Jaccard cannot: a 30-token question inside a 4,000-token
page moves the similarity by well under any usable threshold. That is substring
contamination, it needs a containment-oriented algorithm, and it is a different
design. Every phrase this module produces says "near-duplicate overlap detected
and removed" and never "holdout verified clean", because the second claim is one
this method cannot support.

MinHash and LSH are Curator's (``MinHashStage``, ``LSHStage``,
``BucketsToEdgesStage``) and are GPU-backed. They produce *candidate* pairs — LSH
trades recall for speed and its buckets contain false positives by construction.
What lives here is what Curator does not provide:

* the normalization applied before shingling, declared as data so a report can
  state what was compared rather than leaving it implicit
* **exact** Jaccard verification of candidate pairs, so a removal decision rests
  on a computed similarity and not on a bucket collision
* the direction rule: only the training split ever shrinks

That last one needs stating precisely, because Curator has half of it. On the
*semantic* path ``RankingStrategy.metadata_based(cols, ascending)`` orders each
cluster by arbitrary metadata and ``PairwiseCosineSimilarityStage`` scores each
document only against earlier-ranked ones, so the top-ranked member always
survives — ranking a union on a ``split`` column with ``"holdout" < "train"``
expresses exactly the direction rule, and does it better than anything here.

The fuzzy/exact path this module uses does not: ``_get_removal_ids`` selects with
``duplicated(keep="first")``, an arbitrary member of each group, and the removal
frame carries no provenance to say which side a document came from. So the rule
is enforced here because *this* path cannot express it — not because Curator
cannot. Whether the semantic path is the better substrate is an open question
this module does not settle; see the note in ``curate/decontamination``'s README.

The word "decontamination" itself appears nowhere in Curator's text stages (only
in audio ASR hallucination filtering), but that is a labelling difference, not a
missing capability.

Recall is not asserted anywhere. LSH recall depends on band/row structure and
the corpus, so a number stated here would be a guess; :func:`candidate_recall`
measures it against brute force on a sample instead.
