"""Reproducible ordering and sampling.

Python's built-in :func:`hash` is salted per process through ``PYTHONHASHSEED``,
so anything derived from it changes between runs and between workers. Every
ordering here goes through SHA-256 instead, which costs more and is worth it:
a profile that reports different quantiles on a rerun cannot be used to argue
about a threshold.

Sampling is hash-bottom-k. Taking the first *n* documents biases toward however
the shards happen to be ordered — usually crawl order, which correlates with
almost everything. Keeping the documents whose hash falls lowest is a
deterministic random subset that does not care about file order, worker count,
or how the corpus was sharded.
