"""Quality signals Curator does not provide, parameterised by a language pack.

Every class here is a ``DocumentFilter`` subclass, which is how Curator's own
CLIMB tutorial adds a scorer without modifying the library
(``tutorials/text/nemotron-climb-data-curation/3_prune.py:50``). None of them
contains a language name: the character sets, word lists, patterns and fold maps
all arrive from a :class:`~nemotron.steps.curate.runtime.langpack.LanguagePack`.

The base class is resolved lazily so this module imports on a host without
``nemo_curator``. Subclassing the real base matters at runtime: Curator's
``Score`` stage checks ``isinstance(score_fn, DocumentFilter)`` and would
otherwise treat one of these as a plain callable.

    Scoring is done on NFC. Vietnamese and Devanagari both have two encodings of
    the same correct text, and none of the signals distinguished them: in NFD a
    combining mark is its own codepoint, so ``unicodedata.category(ch)[0] == "L"``
    excludes it and the base letter folds to itself. Measured on one correct
    Vietnamese sentence, NFC vs NFD vs the same text with its diacritics actually

    and a corpus from macOS or OCR is routinely majority-NFD.

    The normalisation is applied to the string handed to ``score_document`` and

    measurement stage that rewrites the text it measures is exactly the defect
    that let a classifier truncate 53.4% of a corpus while every count reconciled.

    The signal is inverted for Vietnamese — diacritic-stripped text scores
    *better* than correct text — and Hindi is rejected outright.

    This is an *addition*, not a bug report. Curator knows: its shipped
    ``heuristic_filter_non_english_pipeline.yaml`` omits ``NonAlphaNumericFilter``,
    ``CommonEnglishWordsFilter`` and ``WordsWithoutAlphabetsFilter`` — exactly the
    three that assume ASCII — where the English pipeline includes all three. So
    the numbers above are what those filters *would* do if reached for, not what
    Curator does to a non-English corpus.

    The gap that leaves is the reason this class exists: dropping the filter
    means a non-English corpus gets no character-composition gate at all, and
    junk that is 80% punctuation passes as readily as prose. Scoring by Unicode
    category rather than by ASCII range restores the gate for any script.

    Uses ``unicodedata.category`` rather than the ``regex`` module. Curator's
    ``constants.py`` does import ``regex`` and uses POSIX classes on the two
    lines above the ASCII one, so the dependency exists; stdlib simply avoids
    adding another.
