"""Per-stage record accounting, with terminal states that must add up.

``curate/audit`` can see that records disappeared. It cannot see **why**,
because an audit that runs afterwards observes only inputs and outputs and has
no way to tell a record removed on purpose from one lost to a swallowed
exception. Attribution requires the producer to say what it did, at the time it
did it. That is what a ledger is.

The contract, enforced for every stage::

    n_input == n_success + n_filtered + n_failed + n_quarantined

Anything else raises. A stage may not report success while records are
unaccounted for.

**Counting records is not enough.** The obvious completeness gate — "fail if
``n_failed + n_quarantined > 0``" — cannot detect the failure it is written for.
Those counts come from reading the shard, and a shard truncated by a killed job
reports zero rows, so a stage can lose a whole file and compute a loss of
exactly zero. :func:`assert_no_lost_units` therefore counts **units**: a shard
that could not be processed is a loss whether or not anyone can say how many
records were in it. Every record count in a failure report is a floor.
