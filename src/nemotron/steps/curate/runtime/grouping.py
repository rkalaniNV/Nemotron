"""Source-document identity, so related records never straddle a split.

Splitting a corpus on a hash of the document text guarantees that *byte
identical* copies land together, and nothing more. That is weaker than it
sounds:

* two crawls of the same page differing only in a nav bar or a timestamp hash
  differently and can land on opposite sides of a train/holdout boundary;
* a corpus that joins ``title`` and ``content`` into ``text`` gives the same
  article republished under a slightly different title a different hash;
* the same source record re-emitted by two crawls keeps one stable ``id`` that a
  content hash ignores entirely.

Each of those is a leak: near-identical text on both sides of a split, which
inflates held-out scores without anything failing. So the group key has to be
the most stable identity available, not the content hash.

Precedence, first non-empty winning:

1. ``url`` — canonicalised, so ``http://a.example/x?utm_source=ads`` and
   ``https://www.A.example/x/`` group together
2. ``id`` — namespaced, because ids are only unique within a corpus; a
   cross-split comparison shares one namespace so a document present in both
   splits keeps a single key
3. normalised-text hash — NFC, casefolded, whitespace-collapsed, which still
   groups text a raw hash would separate
4. raw content hash, then a positional identity as an absolute last resort

The key that was used is recorded alongside the key itself, so a grouping
decision can be inspected after the fact rather than inferred.

    corpora, where equal ids do not imply the same document. The positional
    fallback stays per-side regardless: row 0 of one split is not row 0 of the
