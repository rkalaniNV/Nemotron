"""CLI for ``steps/curate/profile``.

Two passes over the corpus. The first counts documents per source, because a
sample budget cannot be split proportionally without knowing the proportions.
The second draws the allocated number per source and scores only those.

Signals are Curator's own ``DocumentFilter`` classes, called through
:mod:`nemotron.steps.curate.runtime.registry`. They are invoked directly rather
than through Curator's ``Score`` stage: ``Score.process`` is
``df[col] = df[text].apply(fn)``, so on a bounded sample a Ray cluster would add
startup cost without changing the arithmetic. The signals are Curator's either
way; only the loop around them is local. Bypassing the stage means bypassing its
``setup``, so :func:`load_models` replicates the part of it a filter needs.
