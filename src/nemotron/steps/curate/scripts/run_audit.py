"""CLI for ``steps/curate/audit``.

Turns the measurements in :mod:`nemotron.steps.curate.runtime.integrity` into a
report, and decides which of them are findings. The decision rule is the whole
point of the step: a row count that differs from the input is an observation,
because filtering is supposed to remove rows; the same difference contradicting
a manifest the producer wrote is a finding.
