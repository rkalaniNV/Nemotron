"""CLI for ``steps/curate/decontamination``.

Three passes, cheapest first, because each one can make the next unnecessary for
the documents it already resolved:

``group``
    Exact source-document identity across the split — canonical URL, then
    namespaced id, then normalised-text hash. No GPU, no similarity. Catches the
    leak similarity cannot: a page rewritten enough that its shingles no longer
    overlap is still the same source document.

``candidates``
    Curator's ``FuzzyDeduplicationWorkflow`` over the union of both splits.
    GPU-backed, and the reason this step declares ``gpus_per_node = 1`` while
    the other curate steps declare zero. LSH proposes; it does not decide.

``verify``
    Exact Jaccard on every candidate pair, at the *same* shingling the
    candidates were generated with. Then removal — from the training split only.

The union trick matters: Curator's fuzzy dedup deduplicates one corpus against
itself, so both splits are fed in together with a marker and only cross-split
pairs are kept. Same-split pairs are ordinary duplicates and are not this step's
business.
