"""Runner for the curate flow — one config, six steps, one command.

Invoked as a module rather than through ``nemotron steps run``: the flow
orchestrates the six registered steps and is not itself one of them.

Running the curate category by hand means six configs plus a hand-written
approved policy, and the paths between them have to agree. Two of those
agreements are silent when broken: ``curate/nemo_curator`` ships
``emit_manifest: null`` while ``curate/audit`` ships ``declared_manifest: null``,
so an audit run against a producer that emitted no manifest reports counts as
*informational* and claims nothing — which reads exactly like a clean result.
This step derives both from one path, so they cannot disagree.

The shape is deliberately thin. Every step already exposes ``run(cfg) -> report``
(see ``tests/steps/curate/test_step_seam.py``), so this module owns three things
and no algorithms:

``derive``     one authored config becomes six per-step configs
``preflight``  everything that can be refused is refused before any work starts
``run``        the enabled steps, in dependency order, with their reports collected

**The approval gate is not collapsed.** ``curate/profile`` measures and emits
``candidate_policies.yaml`` with ``approved: false``; a threshold only becomes
executable when a person writes an ``approve:`` block naming who decided and on
what evidence. That block cannot appear on the first run, because the candidates
it selects from do not exist yet. So the flow is one config run twice, not one
command that decides for you — and the second run additionally recomputes the
corpus fingerprint and refuses an approval that was granted against different
data, which is what stops a config being copied between corpora with its
approval signature attached.
