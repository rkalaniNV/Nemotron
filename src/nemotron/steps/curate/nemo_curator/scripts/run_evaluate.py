"""Measure a policy against labelled documents: false rejection and noise removal.

Invoked as a module rather than through ``nemotron steps run``, like the flow: it
evaluates a policy the six registered steps produce rather than being one of
them, and it deliberately runs without NeMo Curator so it works in CI and on a
laptop before any cluster exists.

    uv run --extra curate python -m nemotron.steps.curate.nemo_curator.scripts.run_evaluate \\
        --policy ./output/vi/policy/approved_policy.yaml \\
        --labelled ./eval/vi.jsonl \\
        --langpack-dir ./langpacks

The flow writes the approved policy to ``<output_root>/policy/``, not under
``profile/`` -- ``profile/`` holds the *candidates* a person chooses from. And the
policy records which pack calibrated it but not where that pack lives, so
``--langpack-dir`` is required unless the policy was hand-edited to add one.

Two rates come back, and neither is meaningful alone. A gate that drops nothing
has a perfect false-rejection rate; a gate that drops everything has perfect
noise removal. The per-phenomenon table is the part that finds the real defect:
an aggregate over a mostly-clean set reports a good number while rejecting every
OCR-noised document in it.

Exit codes follow the category: 0 measured, 2 a problem the user can fix.
