# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Python 3.11 is now the minimum supported runtime.
- `curate/nemo_curator` now uses a `min_langid_score` of `0.3` when the key is
  omitted, matching both the shipped configuration and NeMo Curator. Set it
  explicitly to `0.0` only when retaining low-confidence language predictions
  is intentional.
- Curation runtimes now use NeMo Curator 1.3.0 and a fixed NeMo Run revision
  instead of moving development branches.
- Approved policies are now bound to the input corpus, signal implementation,
  thresholds, and language-pack content recorded in run manifests.
- Curation manifests, ledgers, input discovery, and artifact handling now reject
  invalid accounting and stale-output states before they can appear successful.
- Language-pack use now requires an explicit pack directory. An opt-in English
  reference pack sourced from Snowball and Unicode CLDR 48 ships with pinned
  provenance and licenses, while other language data remains external and
  private validation fixtures remain test-only. Pack resources are normalized
  to NFC when loaded.
- Release wheels exclude the curation `__local__` workspace so downloaded
  corpora, models, and prior run outputs cannot enter packages.
- Ingest now commits shards only after validation and uses full SHA-256 minted
  ids over unambiguous canonical field framing; subset token caches bind counts
  to document content and reject invalid scores, costs, budgets, and tier writes.
- Decontamination now maps NeMo Curator's named LSH bucket schema back to stable
  corpus ids instead of interpreting final-output parquet columns by position,
  and its CUDA dependencies are available through the separate `curate-gpu`
  extra/runtime.
- The curation flow now preserves canonical field names across ingest handoffs,
  re-verifies approved policies after this run's ingest, and commits lifecycle
  reports atomically so stale success artifacts cannot describe a failed rerun.

### Added

#### Curation Workflow
- Standalone corpus ingest, integrity audit, corpus profiling, deterministic
  token-budget subset, and train/holdout decontamination steps.
- A one-config curation flow that derives cross-step artifact identities,
  preflights invalid combinations, records partial failures, and keeps policy
  approval as an explicit action.
- CPU smoke fixtures and regression coverage for stable identity, accounting,
  policy provenance, nested subsets, and cross-split decontamination.

#### Core Framework
- Artifact system with Pydantic validation for reproducible pipelines
- Support for artifact lineage tracking and metadata
- Scale factors (tiny/small/medium/full) for fast iteration
- Unix piping support between pipeline steps
- Atomic file writes for artifact metadata
- WandbTracker for optional W&B integration
- CLI generation with typer and OmegaConf

#### Training Recipe Structure
- Recipe package structure at `src/nemotron/recipes/`
- Placeholder structure for Nemotron Nano 2 recipe:
  - Stage 0: Pretraining
  - Stage 1: Instruction Tuning
  - Stage 2: Alignment
- Placeholder structure for ChipNeMo/ScaleRTL recipe:
  - Stage 0: Domain Pretraining
  - Stage 1: Supervised Fine-tuning
  - Stage 2: Reasoning Enhancement

#### Examples
- Training pipeline pattern examples in `examples/training/`:
  - `hello.py` - Minimal pipeline step example
  - `tutorial_data_prep.py` - Data preparation patterns
  - `tutorial_training.py` - Training loop patterns
  - `tutorial_evaluation.py` - Evaluation patterns

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with:
  - NVIDIA AI stack integration details (Curator, Megatron-Bridge, Automodel, NeMo-RL, Evaluator)
  - Recipe overview with paper links
  - Usage examples and quick start
- Recipe-specific READMEs with detailed TODO lists
- Contribution guidelines inspired by NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge

#### Testing
- Unit tests for Artifact system
- Test suite with pytest
- 100% test coverage for core framework
