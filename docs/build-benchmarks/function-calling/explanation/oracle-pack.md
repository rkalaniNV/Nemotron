# The Oracle Pack

An oracle pack is the unit of truth for a function-calling benchmark.
It holds the tool schemas a model may call, an executable oracle that actually performs those calls, the templates that describe the conversations, and the assertions that decide whether a replay really succeeded.
All domain content lives in the pack; the generation runtime under `runtime/benchmark_families/bfcl` stays domain-agnostic and contains no branch for any particular domain.

That split is what makes the pipeline reusable. Onboarding a new domain means authoring a pack, not modifying the pipeline, and it also means the pipeline can make claims about a benchmark — that its gold calls execute, that its assertions pass, that its rows are reproducible — without knowing anything about the subject matter.

## Canonical File Layout

A pack is a directory under an `oracle_runtime.allowed_roots` entry. File locations come from `manifest.yaml.paths`, from `oracle_pack.*` overrides in the run configuration, or from these defaults:

| File | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `manifest.yaml` | Yes | Identifies the pack (`pack_id`, `version`) and declares languages, path overrides, primary keys, absent ids, prompts, assistant turn text, and confirmation vocabulary. |
| `tools.json` | Yes | The model-facing function schemas, plus the pack-local `x-mutates` and `x-requires-confirmation` annotations that the pipeline reads but never exposes to a model. |
| `task_templates.yaml` | Yes | Intents, slot sources, conversation policies, milestones, and the success assertions each template claims. |
| `validation_cases.yaml` | Yes | Positive and negative probes proving backend and schema alignment, determinism, error shapes, and confirmation behavior. |
| `assertions.py` | Yes | Deterministic checks over the final oracle state and the executed trace. |
| `backend.py` | One oracle required | A local executable oracle exposing `list_tools`, `reset`, `call_tool`, and `get_state`. |
| `endpoint_config.yaml` | One oracle required | A pinned HTTPS BFCL Oracle HTTP v1 service. |
| `fixtures.json` | Optional | Deterministic records and the initial oracle state passed to `reset`. |
| `held_out.yaml` | Optional | Fixture primary ids and template ids reserved out of ordinary generation. |

Exactly one oracle is allowed: `backend.py` or `endpoint_config.yaml`, never both.
Two oracles would make it impossible to say which one certified a row, so the ambiguity is refused rather than resolved by a precedence rule.
An endpoint pack pins the remote oracle's id, version, and content digest, and that identity must still match during validation, replay, and publication; only HTTPS is accepted and credentials are referenced by environment-variable name rather than stored in the pack.

Two files carry more weight than their size suggests.
`validation_cases.yaml` is what turns "the backend seems to work" into observed evidence, because every tool needs at least one success probe and one negative probe before the pack can be certified.
`assertions.py` is what turns "the trace ran" into "the trace was right": a template with no success assertion has no statement of what success means, so replay could only confirm that its calls executed.

## Certification Tiers And The Gold Gate

`stage=prepare` normalizes the pack and writes `oracle_validation_report.json` containing a tier, the gold-eligibility verdict, the pack fingerprint, per-check failures, and pack statistics.
The checks cover template tool references, slot sources, backend and schema alignment, assertion importability, the declared validation probes, confirmation policy, and a representative generation contract that expands, renders, replays, and asserts the first deterministic instance of every template.

The tier is derived from those individual checks rather than read from a summary flag:

| Tier | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `gold` | Every check passed and the pack has an oracle, templates, and assertions. Gold-eligible. |
| `silver` | The pack has templates and tools but at least one check did not pass. Not gold-eligible. |
| `prototype` | The pack does not yet reach silver. Not gold-eligible. |

`stage=generate` refuses a pack that is not gold-eligible.
A check whose preconditions failed is recorded as `skipped`, never as a pass, so an unrun check keeps a pack below gold instead of letting it inherit one.
The report on disk is a human-readable artifact, not a signed attestation, so generation never trusts one written by an earlier run: it reuses a verdict only when the same process produced it for the same pack and configuration fingerprints.

Because the gold gate is what a released benchmark's credibility rests on, it is worth saying what it is *not*: it certifies that the pack generates and that its own claims hold under execution. It says nothing about whether the domain modeling is a good benchmark of anything.
That judgment stays with the reviewer, and {doc}`authoring-flows` describes where the review boundaries sit.

:::{important}
Gold eligibility requires `oracle_runtime.worker: process`.
A run may configure `worker: thread` as a debugging aid, but such a run can never reach gold.

## Pack Code Runs In A Separate Process

Pack code is executed through a process worker, never inside the process that scores a candidate.
That boundary exists for three separate reasons, and none of them is redundant.
A separate process is the only place a hanging tool can be stopped on a hard deadline.
It is also what sanitizes the environment, so a backend cannot read the caller's environment or wall-clock time and must instead take the frozen clock, seed, timeout, and task id the pipeline hands it.
And during evaluation it keeps the pack's Python out of the evaluator entirely: `backend.py` and `assertions.py` are never imported into the evaluator process, so a pack cannot observe or influence the scoring of the model it is being used to measure.

Errors follow the same logic. A tool returns a failure as data — a structured `{"error": {"code": ...}}` envelope — rather than raising, because a domain rejection is a legitimate outcome the benchmark wants to score, and an exception would be indistinguishable from infrastructure breaking.

## The Fingerprint Pins A Benchmark To Its Source

Generation records a pack fingerprint covering every file in the pack tree, along with a per-file hash map, and the fingerprint is verified before validation, after validation, and again before final output.
Evaluation recomputes it before spending a candidate token and refuses to score if it moved.

The whole tree counts, including files that look inert. A helper module the backend imports changes what the oracle does, and there is no read sandbox that would make a Markdown file provably unreadable to a backend that can open its own directory.
The consequence is worth planning for: publishing a benchmark freezes the pack directory, and any later edit — a comment, a README line — makes every evaluation of that benchmark fail preflight until the bytes are restored.
Keep operational notes about a pack outside the pack, and publish a new release rather than editing a pack that is still being scored.

The aggregate fingerprint proves only that something moved; the per-file map is what lets a drift report name the file and say whether any declared oracle input was involved.
Anything a pack imports from outside its own tree is invisible to the fingerprint, which is why a pack should keep its dependencies inside itself wherever it can.

## The Bundled Packs

Two packs ship under `src/nemotron/steps/byob/data/` and serve different purposes.

`tiny_oracle_pack` is the smallest end-to-end example. It covers single-turn, confirmation, parallel call-group, and irrelevant shapes with no model calls, which makes it the right pack for checking that plumbing, isolation, and output paths work before a real pack exists.

`banking_vn_oracle_pack` is the domain-scale reference. It is worth reading before authoring your own, because it declares a template for every conversation shape the pipeline supports — `single_turn`, `missing_slot`, `confirmation`, `correction`, `multi_tool`, `dependent_call`, `negative_path`, `clarify_only`, and `irrelevant` — and no template narrows `tools_present`, so every row must select its calls out of the full tool catalog.
Read it as a worked example of the pack contract rather than as a default: its inventory, scale, and mix are properties of that pack, not of the framework.
