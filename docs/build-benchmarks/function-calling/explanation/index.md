# Concepts

Background for `nemotron steps run byob/bfcl` with the `bfcl` family: what the pieces are, and why they are arranged this way.

Start with {doc}`../getting-started` if you have not produced a `benchmark.parquet` yet. These pages assume you have seen the pipeline run once.

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`workflow;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Pipeline overview
:link: pipeline-overview
:link-type: doc
Stage order from prepare through publication, what is checkpointed, and why the pipeline refuses configuration it will not honor.

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`package;1.5em;sd-mr-1` The Oracle Pack
:link: oracle-pack
:link-type: doc
The unit of truth: its file layout, the certification tiers, the Gold gate, and why pack code runs in its own process.

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`git-branch;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Authoring flows
:link: authoring-flows
:link-type: doc
Three ways to obtain a pack, one generation pipeline, and the two human authorization boundaries that a model cannot cross.

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`check-circle;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Evaluation
:link: evaluation
:link-type: doc
Trace and executable scoring, the gates that run before any inference, and why the evaluator never sees the gold trace as a prompt.

## Where to Go Next

- To do something rather than understand it, see {doc}`../how-to/index`.
- For field-level detail on configuration and artifacts, see {doc}`../reference/index`.
- The normative contracts live in the source tree next to the code they govern: `src/nemotron/steps/byob/references/bfcl-oracle-pack.md` for the pack, and `src/nemotron/steps/byob/references/bfcl-eval-scoring-contract.md` for scoring.
