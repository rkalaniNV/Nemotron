## Bundled Configurations

The step ships runnable configurations under `src/nemotron/steps/byob/bfcl/config/`. Copy the one closest to your intent rather than starting from an empty file.

Every number in the example files is a worked example for the pack that file points at, not a framework default. Copying another pack's task counts and diversity limits is the most common way to make the balancing stage infeasible.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tiny.yaml` | Pipeline verification run against the bundled `tiny_oracle_pack`. Not publication-eligible. |
| `default.yaml` | Annotated template. Its pack path is a placeholder, so it cannot publish an example domain by omission. |
| `smoke.example.yaml` | Domain-sized verification run. Copy it and repoint it at your own pack. |
| `publication.example.yaml` | Publication-scale, template-only Gold profile with a worked budget and balancing targets. |
| `publication.paraphrase.example.yaml` | The same executable cases with an opt-in model-authored surface role. |
| `eval.default.yaml` | Annotated evaluation template to resolve into your own config. |
| `eval.cli.yaml` | Direct evaluation envelope. |
| `eval.launcher.yaml` | Launcher evaluation envelope. |
| `translate.yaml` | Localization of an already published benchmark. |

## Authoring Input Examples

Those configurations drive generation, which starts only once a reviewed pack exists. The inputs the authoring flows take *before* generation ship as worked examples under `src/nemotron/steps/byob/references/`, taken from a published release.

| File | Used by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bfcl-domain-brief.example.txt` | `--brief` | The reviewed statement of what a source is for, sanitized and bound into the evidence. Refer to {doc}`domain-brief`. |
| `bfcl-domain-brief.skeleton.txt` | copy, complete, then pass to `--brief` | The same thing with the domain taken out: an instruction header to delete, then seven bracketed blocks to replace, each naming what it feeds downstream. Intake rejects any remaining `BFCL-SKELETON` block, so do not pass this file itself. Start with {doc}`domain-brief` rather than editing the banking example. |
| `bfcl-probe-plan.example.json` | `--probe-plan` | A complete plan for certification tier A2: a success per published tool, a state-changing case per mutating tool, structured errors naming their codes, and the required timeout case. Its `fixtures` block is abridged to the records its own cases reach. Refer to {doc}`probe-plan`. |
| `bfcl-authoring-policy.example.yaml` | policy | Organizational defaults a guided session should not ask for twice. |
| `bfcl-endpoint-config.example.yaml` | `endpoint_config.yaml` | A complete endpoint-backed pack declaration, with credentials referenced by environment-variable name only. |

## Command-line Conventions

These pages use `nemotron steps run byob/bfcl -c <CONFIG> stage=<STAGE>`. The same code path
is reachable directly as `python -m nemotron.steps.byob.scripts.run --config <CONFIG>
--stage <STAGE>`, which is convenient when the `nemotron` console script is not on `PATH`.
Every shipped configuration declares `family: bfcl`, so the direct form needs no `--family`;
a configuration that omits the key falls back to the MCQ family, so keep it declared in
configs you write yourself.

The helper commands under `nemotron.steps.byob.scripts` — the pack validator, the bias auditor, the release archiver, the authoring and MCP release commands — share one exit contract, so a wrapper can branch on the status alone:

| Status | Meaning | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | The command ran and the answer was yes: the pack is Gold-eligible, the audit passed, the artifact was written. | The result document on stdout. |
| `1` | The command could not reach an answer. A path was missing, a file would not parse, an invariant was violated. | A JSON failure envelope on stderr with `status`, `error_type`, and `reason`. |
| `2` | The command ran and the answer was no. The pack is not Gold-eligible, the audit found an unexcepted failure, the review packet is blocked. | The full verdict document on stdout, so you can see which check said no. |

The distinction between `1` and `2` is what makes these commands safe to automate: retry on `1`, because a crash may be transient; never retry on `2`, because the verdict will not change until a human changes the inputs.

The evaluator is the exception. `nemotron steps run byob/bfcl` with `stage=eval` publishes a wider taxonomy — `2` through `7` — because an operator needs to know whether to edit a config, fix a candidate endpoint, or investigate a contamination finding. Refer to {doc}`../how-to/run-evaluation`.
