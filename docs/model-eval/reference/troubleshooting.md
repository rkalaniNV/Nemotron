# Troubleshooting

This page maps common `eval/model_eval` failures to the config fields that usually need correction.
In launcher mode, Nemotron builds a launcher config and calls NeMo Evaluator Launcher; task execution, endpoint checks, and result writing are owned by the launcher.
In direct mode, Nemotron runs the harness itself, so most failures surface in `<output_dir>/<task>/harness.log` and are summarized in `failures.txt`.

The first sections apply to both modes; direct-mode-specific symptoms follow under [Direct Mode](#direct-mode).

## Evaluator Extra Missing

Symptom:

```text
Error: nemo-evaluator-launcher is required for evaluation
Install with: uv sync --extra evaluator
```

Recovery:

```bash
uv sync --extra evaluator
```

Then rerun the same `nemotron steps run eval/model_eval` command with `uv run --no-sync`.

## Hosted Endpoint Fails

Most hosted failures come from one of these fields:

| Field | What To Check |
| --- | --- |
| `target.api_endpoint.url` | Full endpoint URL, including `/v1/chat/completions` or `/v1/completions`. |
| `target.api_endpoint.model_id` | Exact model id returned by the endpoint's models API or UI. |
| `target.api_endpoint.api_key_name` | Environment variable name, not the secret value. |
| `target.api_endpoint.type` | `chat` for chat tasks, `completions` for completions/logprob tasks. |

For hosted verification runs in launcher mode, start with `tiny_chat.yaml` and `target.api_endpoint.type=chat`.
In direct mode these fields are set from `EVAL_ENDPOINT_URL`, `EVAL_MODEL_HANDLE`, `EVAL_API_KEY_NAME`, and `EVAL_ENDPOINT_TYPE`.

## Wrong Task For Endpoint Type

Chat tasks need a chat endpoint.
Completions tasks need a completions endpoint, with logprobs support for multiple-choice tasks.
Both families load a client-side tokenizer.

If the harness fails after endpoint setup, check:

```text
tasks
target.api_endpoint.type
evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.extra.tokenizer
```

Use exact task IDs from the launcher registry in launcher mode, or from the harness image in direct mode:

```bash
uv run nemo-evaluator-launcher ls tasks
docker run --rm <harness-image> nemo-evaluator ls
```

## Bad Checkpoint Path

When using `default.yaml`, point `deployment.checkpoint_path` at a concrete Megatron Bridge `iter_*` directory.
Do not point it only at the parent training output directory.

```bash
deployment.checkpoint_path=/path/to/run/iter_0001000
```

Also verify the tokenizer setting:

```bash
evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.extra.tokenizer=/path/to/run/iter_0001000/tokenizer
```

## Launcher Job State

The step prints launcher follow-up commands when the launcher returns an invocation id.

```text
status_command: nemo-evaluator-launcher status <id>
logs_command: nemo-evaluator-launcher logs <id>
```

Run those commands before changing config.
The launcher logs usually distinguish endpoint/authentication failures from task-schema failures.

## Direct Mode

Start with the two run-level files, then the failed task's log:

```bash
cat "$EVAL_RESULTS_DIR/summary.json"
cat "$EVAL_RESULTS_DIR/failures.txt"
tail -n 80 "$EVAL_RESULTS_DIR/<task>/harness.log"
```

`summary.json` records only `ok` or `failed(<code>)`; the cause is in `harness.log`.
`<output_dir>/<task>/eval_factory_metrics.json` reports `response_stats.status_codes` and `successful_count`, which separate authentication failures from timeouts.

### Every Request Returns 404

Cause: `EVAL_MODEL_HANDLE` does not equal the model server's `--served-model-name`.
Fix: set both from one variable.

### `RepositoryNotFoundError` Naming Your Served Model

Symptom: a Hugging Face Hub traceback reports that a repository named after your served model does not exist, and the step printed `Warning: no tokenizer configured`.

Cause: `EVAL_TOKENIZER` is unset, so lm-evaluation-harness falls back to loading the served model name as a Hugging Face repository.
This applies to chat tasks as well as completions tasks.
Fix: set `EVAL_TOKENIZER` to the served model's tokenizer repository id or a local snapshot path.
A tokenizer-extended checkpoint must use its own tokenizer, not the base model's.

### `Tokenizer class TokenizersBackend does not exist`

Cause: Hugging Face exports produced by the tokenizer-extension pipeline declare `"tokenizer_class": "TokenizersBackend"`, which stock `transformers` cannot import.
Fix: copy `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, and `special_tokens_map.json` to a side directory, set `tokenizer_class` to `PreTrainedTokenizerFast`, remove `auto_map`, and point `EVAL_TOKENIZER` at that directory.
Refer to {doc}`../explanation/tokenizer-alignment`.

### Every Request Returns 401

Check, in order:

1. `EVAL_API_KEY_NAME` names the variable that holds the token, not the token itself; the default name is `ENDPOINT_TOKEN`.
1. The named variable is set in the submitting shell. The `*_eval_direct` profiles forward `ENDPOINT_TOKEN`; a differently named variable is not forwarded unless you add it to the profile's `env_vars`.
1. For an endpoint without authentication, set `EVAL_API_KEY_NAME=null`. Pointing the name at an unset variable is an error, not a no-op.

The sovereign container's MILU harness reads its token from `OPENAI_API_KEY` and ignores `--api_key_name`; direct mode exports `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the configured variable automatically.

### Run Never Finishes On `mmlu_prox_completions` Or `mmlu_prox_chat`

Cause: the task expanded to all 29 language subsets because `config.params.task` was not pinned.
The shipped `mmlu_prox` and `mmlu_prox_chat` suites pin it; a bare `-t mmlu_prox_completions` does not.
Fix: add `evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.task=mmlu_prox_<lang>`, one language per run.
The same applies to `global_mmlu` and `global_mmlu_full`.

### Task Not Found In The Harness Image

Symptom: the harness reports an unknown task even though `nemo-evaluator-launcher ls tasks` lists it, or the reverse.

Cause: in direct mode, the task set is whatever `harness_image` ships, and task sets differ between image tags.
For example, `sovereign:26.05` ships no `milu_*` tasks while `sovereign:latest` does, and both report the same version string.
Fix: list the image's tasks with `docker run --rm <harness-image> nemo-evaluator ls`, then pin the resolved digest in `EVAL_HARNESS_IMAGE` for repeatable runs.

### `unsupported nemo_evaluator_config params`

Symptom:

```text
unsupported nemo_evaluator_config params: [...]
Supported: [...]
Pass harness-specific arguments under `extra:`.
```

Cause: a top-level key under `config.params` is not in the direct-mode allowlist (`task`, `limit_samples`, `parallelism`, `request_timeout`, `max_retries`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_new_tokens`, `extra`).
Fix: move harness-specific arguments under `extra:`.

(model-eval-troubleshooting-profile-not-found)=
### `--batch` Profile Not Found

Cause: `env.toml` is generated and then ignored by Git, so a file created before the `*_eval_direct` profiles were added does not contain them.
Fix: copy the profile from `src/nemotron/steps/env/env_toml/config/<backend>.yaml` into your `env.toml`, preserving your site-specific values.
A CPU-only profile that inherits a GPU base may also inherit a shared-memory request that no CPU shape can satisfy, and the scheduler rejects the submission before a job exists; neither config generation nor `--dry-run` catches that.

### Output Directory Is Claimed Or Not Empty

Symptom:

```text
<output_dir> is claimed by another run (pid ... on ..., started ...)
```

Cause: `.nemotron-eval.lock` exists because a run is in progress, or a preempted job left its claim behind.
Fix: use a different `output_dir`, or delete the lock file if the run is definitely gone; the message reports the claim's age.
`overwrite=true` replaces non-empty task directories, but does not override a live claim.

### Harness Exits Client-Side While The Endpoint Returns 200

Cause: `adapter_config.use_caching` was disabled, so the harness held every request and response in memory; around 30 000 requests it exits on a large CPU shape while the endpoint is healthy.
Fix: keep `use_caching: true` (the `direct.yaml` default), and use `EVAL_LIMIT_SAMPLES` for large splits.
Caching removes the memory ceiling; it has not been shown to make an unbounded full split finish.

### `TimeoutError` Late In A Long Generative Task

Cause: `request_timeout` is a deadline measured from request creation, and lm-evaluation-harness creates every request up front behind a concurrency semaphore, so queued requests consume the clock while waiting.
Fix: raise `request_timeout` and `parallelism` together; lowering concurrency makes it worse.
For MCQA tasks on a base model, also set `config.params.max_new_tokens` to a small value; MILU's default of 1024 lets a model without a stop token generate to the cap.
Large MILU splits can still abort this way; smaller splits and `limit_samples` runs complete normally.
