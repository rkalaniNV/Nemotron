# About Model Evaluation

The `eval/model_eval` Nemotron step scores a model on NeMo Evaluator benchmark tasks and writes an `eval_results` artifact to disk.
The model is always reached over HTTP through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
The step runs in one of two *execution modes*: *launcher mode*, which hands the run to NeMo Evaluator Launcher and can deploy a Megatron Bridge checkpoint for you, and *direct mode*, which runs the evaluation harness inside the step's own job against an endpoint that you host.
The {ref}`model-eval-choose-a-mode` section explains how to pick one.

:::{tip}
New to model evaluation or the Nemotron CLI?
Read {doc}`using-skills` for a short guide to productive agent sessions, then start the {doc}`getting-started` tutorial to run one benchmark on one sample against a hosted endpoint.
:::

## When To Use

Use `eval/model_eval` when the work matches one of the following.

- Score a trained checkpoint with NeMo Evaluator Launcher tasks.
- Score a model that you already serve, on any Nemotron backend, with one of the shipped benchmark suites such as `base_en` or `instruct_en`.
- Compare a new training run against a baseline by running the same task set against both, with generation parameters and endpoint type held constant.
- Perform a verification run against a hosted endpoint, to confirm the URL, credential, and model id before scaling up.
- Pair this step with a baseline evaluation before training to capture before-and-after measurements around a training change, by following {ref}`model-eval-comparing-runs`.

(model-eval-choose-a-mode)=
## Choose A Mode

Both modes evaluate over HTTP and write the same `eval_results` artifact.
They differ in who creates the endpoint and who schedules the evaluation job.

| Question | Launcher mode | Direct mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How do I select it? | `-c default` (the runspec default; `mode: launcher`) | `-c direct`, or a suite config that inherits from `direct.yaml` (`mode: direct`) |
| Who serves the model? | NeMo Evaluator Launcher can deploy a Megatron Bridge checkpoint (`deployment.*`), or you point it at an existing endpoint (`deployment.type: none`). | You. Direct mode never creates or tears down an endpoint. |
| Who schedules the evaluation job? | The launcher's own executor, selected with `run.env.launcher_executor` (`local`, `slurm`, or `lepton`). | The Nemotron `--batch` profile, so every Nemotron backend works: `slurm_eval_direct`, `lepton_eval_direct`, `dgxcloud_eval_direct`. |
| Where do task names come from? | The launcher registry: `nemo-evaluator-launcher ls tasks`. | The selected harness image: `nemo-evaluator ls` inside that image. Harness-only tasks, such as MILU, are addressable. |
| How is it configured? | YAML plus dotlist overrides. | Environment variables (`EVAL_ENDPOINT_URL`, `EVAL_MODEL_HANDLE`, `EVAL_TOKENIZER`, `EVAL_RESULTS_DIR`, and related) plus `-t <task>` and dotlist overrides. |
| What is recorded? | The saved launcher config and the launcher invocation id. | `summary.json`, `run_manifest.json` with harness image, digest pinning, and merged per-task parameters, and `failures.txt` when a task fails. |
| Does it export to W&B? | Optional, through `execution.auto_export` and `export.wandb`. | No. Direct mode writes files and needs no tracker credentials. |

Choose **launcher mode** when you want the tool to deploy a Megatron Bridge checkpoint on a local machine or a Slurm cluster, or when you want the launcher's status and log commands.
Start with {doc}`getting-started` and {doc}`how-to/evaluate-deployed-checkpoint`.

Choose **direct mode** when the model is already served, when you run on a backend the launcher has no executor for (Run:ai and DGX Cloud), or when the benchmark exists in a harness image but not in the launcher registry.
Start with {doc}`how-to/run-direct-mode-evaluation` and {doc}`how-to/run-a-benchmark-suite`.

:::{note}
Launcher-managed Lepton deployment is experimental: the launcher's Lepton executor does not accept the `generic` deployment type that `default.yaml` uses, and it does not remove created endpoints after a run.
On Lepton, host the endpoint yourself and evaluate it with direct mode.

    deploy --> step["eval/model_eval<br/>launcher mode or direct mode"]
    step --> results["eval_results<br/>per-task subdirs, summary.json,<br/>run_manifest.json"]
```

In launcher mode, NeMo Evaluator Launcher owns task execution and result files under `output_dir`.
In direct mode, the step runs `nemo-evaluator run_eval` once per task and writes `summary.json`, `run_manifest.json`, and one directory per task under `output_dir`.
For the contract and the on-disk layout, refer to {doc}`reference/output-artifacts`.

## How It Works

The runner reads a single YAML document and applies command-line overrides.
It then branches on the `mode` key.

- In launcher mode, it removes Nemotron-only keys, saves the resolved launcher config, and calls `nemo_evaluator_launcher.api.functional.run_eval`.
- In direct mode, it resolves the endpoint and task list from the environment, writes `run_manifest.json`, and runs `nemo-evaluator run_eval` for each task inside the current job.

The endpoint type must match the benchmark family.
Chat and instruction benchmarks need a *chat* endpoint.
*Log-probability* tasks, such as HellaSwag, need a *completions* endpoint with `logprobs` support.
In both cases the harness tokenizes on the client side, so a tokenizer that matches the served model is required.

The hosted verification config is `tiny_chat.yaml`.
The launcher checkpoint-evaluation config is `default.yaml`.
The direct-mode base config is `direct.yaml`, and the shipped suites `base_en`, `mmlu_prox`, `milu`, `instruct_en`, and `mmlu_prox_chat` each add a task list on top of it.
Generation settings live under `evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params`.

For the full concept set behind these design rules, refer to {doc}`explanation/index`.

````

## Before You Start

- The Nemotron repository is synced and `uv sync --extra evaluator` is complete.
- A bearer token is exported as the environment variable named in `target.api_endpoint.api_key_name` (launcher mode) or `EVAL_API_KEY_NAME` (direct mode).
  Hosted verification runs usually use `NVIDIA_API_KEY`; direct mode defaults to `ENDPOINT_TOKEN`.
- A reachable evaluation endpoint URL and a model identifier the endpoint advertises.
  In direct mode the identifier must equal the server's `--served-model-name`.
- A tokenizer that matches the served model.
  Direct mode requires `EVAL_TOKENIZER` for chat and completions suites alike.
- For direct mode on a cluster, an `env.toml` that contains the `<backend>_eval_direct` profile.
  Refer to {ref}`model-eval-troubleshooting-profile-not-found` if the profile is missing.

## Limitations And Considerations

- Cost: every benchmark sample issues at least one request to the endpoint, and hosted endpoints incur per-token cost.
- Rate limits: hosted endpoints throttle concurrent requests, so set `evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.parallelism` to a value the endpoint can serve.
- Deployment: `tiny_chat.yaml` and `direct.yaml` target an already-deployed endpoint; `default.yaml` uses launcher-managed deployment for a Megatron Bridge checkpoint.
  Direct mode does not serve checkpoints and does not iterate over checkpoints; the loop over checkpoints is yours.
- Multi-subset tasks: `mmlu_prox_completions`, `mmlu_prox_chat`, `global_mmlu`, and `global_mmlu_full` cover every language by default.
  Pin one subset per run, as described in {doc}`how-to/run-a-benchmark-suite`.
- Sample limits: a run with `limit_samples` set scores a deterministic first-N subset, not the full split, and should be reported as such.
- Comparability: scores are comparable when the endpoint type, task version, tokenizer, and generation parameters are held constant across runs.
  The {ref}`model-eval-comparing-runs` section explains the framing.
