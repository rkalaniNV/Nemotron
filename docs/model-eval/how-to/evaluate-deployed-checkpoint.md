# Evaluate A Deployed Checkpoint

This guide covers the two launcher-mode evaluation shapes in the `eval/model_eval` step.

- Use `tiny_chat.yaml` when the model is already hosted behind an OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint and the launcher's local executor is acceptable.
- Use `default.yaml` when NeMo Evaluator Launcher should deploy a Megatron Bridge checkpoint and run the configured tasks on a local machine or a Slurm cluster.

To evaluate an endpoint you host from a Nemotron-scheduled job on any backend, including Run:ai and DGX Cloud, use direct mode instead: {doc}`run-direct-mode-evaluation`.
Direct mode does not deploy checkpoints.

## Prerequisites

- `uv sync --extra evaluator` has completed.
- For hosted evaluation, you have the endpoint URL, model id, and API key environment variable.
- For checkpoint evaluation, you have a concrete Megatron Bridge `iter_*` checkpoint path.

## Hosted Endpoint Path

For an existing endpoint, use the same command shape as {doc}`run-hosted-evaluation`.

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
export NEMO_EVALUATOR_MODEL_URL="https://<endpoint>/v1/chat/completions"
export NEMO_EVALUATOR_MODEL_ID="<served-model-name>"

uv run --no-sync nemotron steps run eval/model_eval \
  -c tiny_chat \
  output_dir=./output/eval-hosted \
  target.api_endpoint.url="$NEMO_EVALUATOR_MODEL_URL" \
  target.api_endpoint.model_id="$NEMO_EVALUATOR_MODEL_ID" \
  target.api_endpoint.api_key_name=NVIDIA_API_KEY \
  target.api_endpoint.type=chat
```

## Launcher-Managed Checkpoint Path

For Megatron Bridge checkpoints, use `default.yaml`.
Point `deployment.checkpoint_path` at the concrete iteration directory.

```bash
uv run --no-sync nemotron steps run eval/model_eval \
  -c default \
  output_dir=./output/eval-megatron \
  deployment.checkpoint_path=/path/to/run/iter_0001000 \
  evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.limit_samples=1
```

The default config uses the launcher `deployment` block to serve the checkpoint and then runs the configured `tasks`.
Select the launcher executor with `run.env.launcher_executor=local` or `run.env.launcher_executor=slurm`; Slurm also needs `run.env.host`, `run.env.user`, `run.env.account`, and `run.env.partition`.
Keep `evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.extra.tokenizer` aligned with the deployed checkpoint; `default.yaml` sets it to `${deployment.checkpoint_path}/tokenizer`.

:::{note}
Launcher-managed deployment on Lepton is experimental.
The launcher's Lepton executor rejects the `generic` deployment type that `default.yaml` uses, and it does not remove the endpoints it creates after a run.
On Lepton, serve the model yourself and use direct mode.
:::

## Endpoint And Task Pairing

The endpoint type must match the task family.
Chat and instruction tasks need `target.api_endpoint.type=chat`.
Log-probability tasks such as HellaSwag need a completions endpoint with logprobs support.
Both families need a tokenizer that matches the served model.
For the matching rule, refer to {doc}`../explanation/endpoint-types-and-benchmarks`.

## What To Check After Submission

The step prints the launcher config path.
When NeMo Evaluator Launcher returns an invocation id, it also prints:

```text
status_command: nemo-evaluator-launcher status <invocation-id>
logs_command: nemo-evaluator-launcher logs <invocation-id>
```

Run those commands to monitor the job, then inspect `output_dir` after completion.
