# Tokenizer Alignment

lm-evaluation-harness loads a tokenizer on the client side for both completions and chat endpoints.
The tokenizer must therefore be configured for every run, and it must be the tokenizer of the model that the endpoint serves.

## Where The Tokenizer Lives

Tokenizer settings live under:

```text
evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.extra.tokenizer
evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.extra.tokenizer_backend
```

The `default.yaml` config sets the tokenizer to `${deployment.checkpoint_path}/tokenizer`, which matches the Megatron Bridge checkpoint path when that checkpoint contains a tokenizer subdirectory.

The `direct.yaml` config, and every suite that inherits from it, reads the tokenizer from the `EVAL_TOKENIZER` environment variable and sets `tokenizer_backend: huggingface` and `tokenized_requests: false`.
Direct mode prints a warning before the first task if no tokenizer is configured.

## Why It Is Required

With `extra.tokenizer` unset, the harness falls back to the `model=` value, which is the endpoint's served-model-name.
It then attempts to load that name as a Hugging Face repository and fails with `RepositoryNotFoundError`, an error that names your served-model-name as a missing repository.
A chat endpoint does not exempt a run from this requirement: `ifeval`, `mmlu_instruct`, and `gsm8k_cot_instruct` all load a tokenizer.

## Why It Must Match

Log-probability tasks ask the endpoint to score candidate token sequences that the harness has already tokenized.
If the evaluator tokenizes candidates differently from the served model, the model scores the wrong token ids and the metric is not meaningful.

A tokenizer-extended checkpoint must use its own extended tokenizer, not the base model's.
The base tokenizer would tokenize every prompt differently from the served model, and the run would complete with scores that are silently wrong.
The `tokenizer_extension` step category produces such checkpoints together with their extended tokenizer.

## Accepted Shapes

Use one of these tokenizer values when a selected task requires local tokenization:

- A Hugging Face model id.
- A filesystem path containing tokenizer files.
- The `tokenizer/` subdirectory inside a Megatron Bridge `iter_*` checkpoint.

Use `huggingface` for `evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.extra.tokenizer_backend` unless the selected launcher task explicitly requires another backend.

## Tokenizer Exports From Tokenizer Extension

Hugging Face exports produced by the tokenizer-extension pipeline declare `"tokenizer_class": "TokenizersBackend"`, which stock `transformers` cannot import.
lm-evaluation-harness then fails with `Tokenizer class TokenizersBackend does not exist`.
Copy `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, and `special_tokens_map.json` to a side directory, set `tokenizer_class` to `PreTrainedTokenizerFast`, remove `auto_map`, and point `EVAL_TOKENIZER` at that directory.
The vocabulary is unchanged; only the loader class differs.
