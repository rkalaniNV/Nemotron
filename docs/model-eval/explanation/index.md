# Concepts

The pages in this section cover the design rules behind `eval/model_eval`.
Read them when you want to understand why the how-to pages take the actions they do, before you change a configuration default or adapt a recipe to a new deployment.

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`graph;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Pipeline Overview
:link: pipeline-overview
:link-type: doc
Launcher mode and direct mode: who serves the model, who schedules the job, and what each writes into `eval_results`.

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`plug;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Endpoint Types And Benchmark Families
:link: endpoint-types-and-benchmarks
:link-type: doc
Chat versus completions endpoints, which shipped suites and benchmark families match each one, and why reasoning models need a parser.

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`package;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Tokenizer Alignment
:link: tokenizer-alignment
:link-type: doc
Why every run needs a client-side tokenizer that matches the served model, including tokenizer-extended checkpoints.
