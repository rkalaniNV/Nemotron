# Generate Persona-Grounded MCQ Data for SFT

Use this guide when you need multilingual, multiple-choice supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data whose questions are grounded in regional personas and whose answers have been cross-checked by several teacher models.

`sdg/persona_mcq` is a separate step from `sdg/data_designer`. It embeds a Data Designer column for question authoring inside a resumable eight-stage pipeline that deduplicates the questions, collects answers from a *teacher panel* (three or more models that answer every question independently), keeps only records on which the panel agrees, and writes aligned `train.jsonl` files per teacher and language mix.

Use `byob/mcq` instead when the output is a held-out benchmark or evaluation set rather than training data.

## Outcomes

- Run the pipeline on the shipped `tiny` configuration to validate model endpoints and persona assets.
- Understand what each stage consumes and produces, and how to resume or rerun selected stages.
- Select a teacher and language-mix variant and pass it to `sft/automodel` or `data_prep/sft_packing`.

## How It Works

The pipeline runs these stages in a fixed order; a selected stage requires the outputs of the stages before it:

| Stage | Consumes | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| `personas` | `languages.*.locale` | Cached Data Designer persona assets for every configured locale |
| `questions` | Personas, `question_models` | One MCQ per persona sample, per question model and language |
| `lexical_dedup` | Question records | Structurally valid, script-filtered, exact- and MinHash-deduplicated questions pooled across question models |
| `semantic_dedup` | Lexically deduplicated questions | Near-duplicate removal by cosine similarity of `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large` embeddings |
| `answer_seed` | Deduplicated questions | Stable `query_id` values and deterministic option shuffles |
| `answers` | Answer seed, `answer_models` | Per-teacher answers, parsed answer letters, and retryable failures |
| `build_sft` | All teacher answers | Vote per question, then quality-gated `{messages, metadata}` records per response teacher |
| `sample` | Gated records | Aligned `train.jsonl` and `blend.json` files per teacher, all languages and English/target views |

Each question is authored from a deterministic sample of one persona *facet* (for example geography, profession, or cuisine) and one difficulty level; the sampling weights are defined in the plugin's `taxonomy.py`. The question, options, and final answer marker are written in the configured target language, while `sft.reasoning` independently requires the retained reasoning to be in English in the shipped configurations.

Voting is a consistency gate, not factual verification. With `sft.agreement: unanimous`, every teacher's parsed letter must match; with `majority`, strictly more than half must. A record is also rejected when the exporting teacher dissents from the vote, when its response was truncated, or when the answer or reasoning falls outside the configured script-fraction ranges. `summary.json` records the count for each rejection reason.

## Prerequisites

- Install the SDG extra: `uv sync --extra data-sdg`. It provides `data-designer`, `sentence-transformers`, and `torch`.
- The [NGC CLI](https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/installers/cli) on `PATH` and `NGC_API_KEY` exported. The `personas` stage downloads missing persona assets with it; cached runs do not need the key.
- Three OpenAI-compatible endpoints and one API key, exported as `QWEN_API_BASE`, `OSS_API_BASE`, `GEMMA_API_BASE`, and `NVIDIA_API_KEY`. The shipped configurations resolve endpoints from these variables and read the key from the environment at request time; neither is written to run metadata.
- `HF_TOKEN` when the embedding model is gated or anonymous Hugging Face Hub rate limits are a concern.
- A GPU for production semantic deduplication (`semantic_dedup.device: cuda` in `default.yaml`). The `tiny` configuration uses `cpu`.

## Procedure

1. Run the `tiny` configuration with a fresh experiment name:

   ```console
   $ export NGC_API_KEY='<your-ngc-api-key>'
   $ export NVIDIA_API_KEY='<your-api-key>'
   $ export QWEN_API_BASE='<endpoint>' OSS_API_BASE='<endpoint>' GEMMA_API_BASE='<endpoint>'
   $ uv run nemotron steps run sdg/persona_mcq -c tiny pipeline.experiment_name=my-verification
   ```

   `tiny` authors 8 questions per language from one question model, answers with three teachers, and samples one record per language. Artifacts are written under `${NEMOTRON_RUN_DIR:-./outputs}/persona_mcq/my-verification/`.

2. Inspect `summary.json` in the experiment directory. Confirm that the `answers` entries report `unparsed: 0` for every teacher and language, and review the rejection reasons under `build_sft` (`no_agreement`, `teacher_dissents`, `truncated`, `answer_language_impurity`, `reasoning_language_impurity`) before scaling.

3. Run the production-shaped defaults:

   ```console
   $ uv run nemotron steps run sdg/persona_mcq -c default pipeline.experiment_name=my-run
   ```

   `default.yaml` requests 100,000 questions per question model and language and samples 50,000 records per language. For cluster execution, use the `*_sdg_persona_mcq` environment profile for your backend as described in {doc}`dispatch-to-cluster`; the profiles request one GPU for semantic deduplication and forward `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `NGC_API_KEY`, and the three `*_API_BASE` variables from the submitting shell.

   ```console
   $ export NEMOTRON_ENV_FILE=env.slurm.toml
   $ uv run nemotron steps run sdg/persona_mcq -c default pipeline.experiment_name=my-run --batch slurm_sdg_persona_mcq
   ```

4. Resume or rerun selected stages with the same experiment name. Failed answer rows in `answers/<model>/<language>/failures.jsonl` are retried on resume; completed rows are skipped:

   ```console
   $ uv run nemotron steps run sdg/persona_mcq -c default \
       pipeline.experiment_name=my-run 'pipeline.stages=[answers,build_sft,sample]'
   ```

   Reusing an experiment name with a different configuration is rejected. Choose a new name, or set `pipeline.overwrite=true` to delete the experiment directory and start again.

5. Select a training file. Each response teacher has a root view containing all configured languages and one `english_<target>` view per non-English language containing equal counts of English and target-language records:

   ```text
   <output_root>/<experiment_name>/training/<teacher>/train.jsonl
   <output_root>/<experiment_name>/training/<teacher>/english_hindi/train.jsonl
   <output_root>/<experiment_name>/training/<teacher>/english_malayalam/train.jsonl
   ```

## Adapt the Configuration

- **Add a language.** Add an entry under `languages` with `display_name`, `locale`, `answer_label`, `script_pattern`, and the two script-fraction ranges; set `strip_latin_glosses: true` for non-Latin scripts where parenthetical Latin glosses should be removed. Data Designer supplies the persona locales; the shipped Malayalam entry reuses `en_IN` personas because no managed Malayalam locale exists.
- **Change the region.** Override a locale, for example `languages.english.locale=en_US`. Geography comes from the sampled persona, not from the configuration key names.
- **Change the teacher panel.** Add a model alias under `models` and list it in `answer_models` and `sft.response_teachers`. At least three answer models are required, and every response teacher must be an answer model. Pointing several aliases at one endpoint is suitable only for verification runs.
- **Relax agreement.** Set `sft.agreement=majority` when unanimous agreement leaves too few records.
- **Adjust the reasoning mix.** `sampling.reasoning_off_fraction` (default `0.10`) is applied per language; `sampling.answer_variant=stripped` replaces the assistant `content` with only `<answer_label>: <letter>`.

## Downstream Use

Pass a selected `train.jsonl` to AutoModel SFT directly:

```console
$ uv run nemotron steps run sft/automodel \
    -c <project>/config/sft_automodel.yaml \
    dataset.path_or_dataset_id=<output_root>/<experiment_name>/training/gemma/english_malayalam/train.jsonl
```

For Megatron-Bridge, pack the same view through its `blend.json` first:

```console
$ uv run nemotron steps run data_prep/sft_packing \
    -c <project>/config/sft_packing.yaml \
    blend_path=<output_root>/<experiment_name>/training/gemma/english_malayalam/blend.json
```

The `sample` entry of `summary.json` lists every teacher/view combination with per-language record and reasoning-off counts, so orchestration does not need to infer filenames.
