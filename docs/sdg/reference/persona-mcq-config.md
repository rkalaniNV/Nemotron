# Persona MCQ Configuration Reference

Configuration fields, output artifacts, and named errors for `sdg/persona_mcq`. For the procedure, refer to {doc}`../how-to/persona-mcq-data`.

## Command

```text
uv run nemotron steps run sdg/persona_mcq -c {default|tiny} [-d] [--run PROFILE | --batch PROFILE] [KEY=VALUE ...]
```

Overrides use OmegaConf dotlist syntax. List values are passed in brackets and quoted for the shell, for example `'pipeline.stages=[answers,build_sft,sample]'`. Shipped environment profiles are `<backend>_sdg_persona_mcq` and `<backend>_sdg_persona_mcq_tiny` for `lepton`, `slurm`, and `dgxcloud`.

## Shipped Configuration

```{literalinclude} ../../../src/nemotron/steps/sdg/persona_mcq/config/default.yaml
:language: yaml
:class: scrollable
```

`tiny.yaml` differs from `default.yaml` in `pipeline.experiment_name` (`persona-mcq-smoke`), `question_models` (`[oss]`), reduced inference parallelism and token limits, `question_generation.num_records: 8`, `semantic_dedup.device: cpu`, `answer_generation.max_retries: 3`, and `sampling.per_language: 1`.

## Fields

### `pipeline`

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `experiment_name` | `persona-mcq` | Required. Artifact directory name under `output_root`; also identifies the configuration for resume checks. |
| `output_root` | `${NEMOTRON_RUN_DIR:-./outputs}/persona_mcq` | Parent directory for experiments. |
| `stages` | `[all]` | `[all]` or an ordered subset of `personas`, `questions`, `lexical_dedup`, `semantic_dedup`, `answer_seed`, `answers`, `build_sft`, `sample`. `all` cannot be combined with named stages. |
| `seed` | `42` | Seed for question authoring and answer-seed option shuffles. |
| `resume` | `true` | Skip completed question outputs and answered rows; reload the existing `summary.json`. |
| `overwrite` | `false` | Delete the experiment directory before running. Required to reuse an experiment name with a different configuration. |

### `languages.<key>`

Every entry is independent; the key names carry no language-specific behavior.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `display_name` | yes | Language name inserted into authoring and answering prompts. |
| `locale` | yes | Data Designer persona locale, for example `en_IN` or `hi_Deva_IN`. |
| `answer_label` | yes | Localized final-answer marker; the assistant's last line must be `<answer_label>: <LETTER>`. |
| `answer_label_aliases` | no | Additional accepted markers when parsing teacher answers. |
| `script_pattern` | yes | Single-character regular expression for the target script. Must not match the empty string. |
| `question_script_fraction` | yes | `{min, max}` inclusive range for the fraction of alphabetic characters in a question that match `script_pattern`. |
| `answer_script_fraction` | yes | The same range applied to the exported assistant answer. |
| `strip_latin_glosses` | no (`false`) | Remove parenthetical Latin-script glosses from questions and options before deduplication. |

### `question_models`, `answer_models`, and `models.<alias>`

`question_models` lists the aliases whose questions are pooled before deduplication. `answer_models` lists the teacher panel; at least three are required. Every alias must be defined under `models`.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | yes | Model identifier sent to the endpoint. |
| `endpoint` | yes | OpenAI-compatible base URL; the shipped configurations resolve `${oc.env:*_API_BASE}`. |
| `api_key_env` | yes | Name of the environment variable holding the bearer token. The value is never written to run metadata. |
| `provider_type` | no (`openai`) | Data Designer provider type for question authoring. |
| `skip_health_check` | no (`false`) | Skip the Data Designer endpoint health check. |
| `extra_headers` | no | Additional HTTP headers for question authoring. |
| `question.inference` | no | Data Designer `ChatCompletionInferenceParams` for authoring: `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `max_parallel_requests`, `timeout`, `extra_body`. |
| `answer` | no | Answer request parameters: `temperature` (`1.0`), `top_p` (`1.0`), `max_tokens` (`16384`), and `extra_body` merged into the request body. |

### `question_generation`

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `num_records` | `100000` | Questions requested per question model and language. |
| `max_parallel_requests` | `256` | Data Designer non-inference worker parallelism. |
| `buffer_size` | `500` | Data Designer run buffer size. |

### `lexical_dedup`

| `bands` | `16` | Locality-sensitive hashing bands. |
| `seed` | `42` | MinHash seed. |

### `semantic_dedup`

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large` | Sentence Transformers embedding model. Questions are embedded with the `query: ` prefix. |
| `device` | `cuda` | Embedding device. `tiny.yaml` uses `cpu`. |
| `batch_size` | `256` | Embedding batch size. |
| `threshold` | `0.965` | Cosine-similarity threshold for a near-duplicate pair; must be between 0 and 1. |
| `method` | `greedy` | `greedy` visits records in a seeded random order, keeps each unvisited record, and removes its similar neighbors; `components` keeps one randomly chosen record per connected component of similar pairs. |
| `seed` | `13` | Seed for the keep order. |
| `chunk_size` | `4096` | Rows per similarity block. |

### `answer_generation`

| Field | Default | Description |

| `timeout` | `600` | HTTP timeout in seconds. |
| `max_retries` | `5` | Attempts per row; HTTP 429 and 5xx responses are retried with exponential back-off capped at 30 seconds. |

### `sft`

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `response_teachers` | `[qwen, oss, gemma]` | Teachers whose answers are exported. Each must also appear in `answer_models`. |
| `agreement` | `unanimous` | `unanimous`: every parsed letter must match. `majority`: strictly more than half of the panel must match. The exporting teacher must match the vote. |
| `reasoning.display_name` | `English` | Language requested for the reasoning. |
| `reasoning.script_pattern` | `[A-Za-z]` | Script matcher for the reasoning. |
| `reasoning.script_fraction` | `{min: 0.85, max: 1.0}` | Inclusive script-fraction range for the retained reasoning. |

### `sampling`

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `per_language` | `50000` | Records sampled per language from the questions that every response teacher exported. |
| `seed` | `42` | Sampling and shuffle seed. |
| `reasoning_off_fraction` | `0.10` | Fraction of sampled records per language that omit `reasoning_content`; the selection is deterministic in `seed` and `query_id`. |
| `answer_variant` | `full` | `full` keeps the teacher's answer text; `stripped` replaces it with `<answer_label>: <letter>`. |

## Output Artifacts

All paths are relative to `<output_root>/<experiment_name>/`.

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `run.json` | Redacted configuration, `config_hash`, `data_designer_version`, and `nemotron_commit`. |
| `summary.json` | Per-stage statistics: cached and downloaded locales, question counts, deduplication drop reasons, answer counts, `build_sft` rejection reasons, and sample views. Rewritten after every stage. |
| `questions/<model>/<language>/records.jsonl` | Authored question records and Data Designer artifacts. |
| `lexical/<language>.jsonl` | Pooled, lexically deduplicated questions with `query_id`, `question`, `choices`, and provenance `metadata`. |
| `semantic/<language>.jsonl` | Semantically deduplicated questions. |
| `answer_seed/<language>.jsonl` | Shuffled options with `original_choices` and `shuffle_permutation`. |
| `answers/<model>/<language>/answers.jsonl` | Teacher responses with `answer`, `reasoning`, `parsed_letter`, `finish_reason`, and `completion_tokens`. Append-safe on resume. |
| `answers/<model>/<language>/failures.jsonl` | Rows that failed after `max_retries`; retried on resume. |
| `sft/<teacher>/<language>.jsonl` | Quality-gated `{messages, metadata}` records. |
| `training/<teacher>/train.jsonl`, `blend.json` | Aligned samples across all configured languages and the corresponding SFT-packing blend manifest. |
| `training/<teacher>/english_<language>/train.jsonl`, `blend.json` | Equal-count English/target views, written when a language named `english` is configured. |

### Training Record

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": ""},
    {"role": "user", "content": "<answer instruction>\n\n<question>\n\nA) ...\nB) ...\nC) ...\nD) ..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "reasoning_content": "<English reasoning>", "content": "<answer text ending in answer_label: LETTER>"}
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "query_id": "...",
    "language": "hindi",
    "answer_label": "उत्तर",
    "reasoning_language": "English",
    "response_model": "gemma",
    "agreement": "unanimous",
    "voted_letter": "B",
    "n_valid_votes": 3,
    "difficulty": "...",
    "topic": "...",
    "facet": "...",
    "region": "...",
    "gen_model": "oss",
    "persona_uuid": "...",
    "reasoning_mode": "on"
  }
}
```

Records with `reasoning_mode: "off"` omit `reasoning_content`.

## Errors

| Error | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `experiment_config_mismatch` | The experiment directory was created with a different configuration (`config_hash` differs). | Choose a new `pipeline.experiment_name`, or set `pipeline.overwrite=true` intentionally. Never combine artifacts from incompatible configurations. |
| `persona_assets_missing` | A configured locale has no cached persona asset and `NGC_API_KEY` is unset or the NGC CLI is not on `PATH`. | Export `NGC_API_KEY` and install the NGC CLI, or download personas for every locale with the Data Designer CLI before running. |
| `teacher_intersection_too_small` | Fewer questions survived every response teacher's gates than `sampling.per_language` requests. | Inspect the `build_sft` rejection reasons in `summary.json`; reduce `sampling.per_language`, relax `sft.agreement`, or resume the `answers` stage to retry failed rows. |

Configuration validation also rejects fewer than three `answer_models`, response teachers absent from `answer_models`, unknown stage names, invalid `script_pattern` values, script-fraction ranges outside `0 <= min <= max <= 1`, and `permutations` not divisible by `bands`.
